Dice 21

The user has to determine two things before they can play
First they have to choose to play with 1 or 2 dices
Then how many Bitcoins they want to gamble

The game starts and the dice/dices are rolled
After each roll the user can keep rolling the dice/dices or stop

If the user keeps rolling the dice/dices
    Dice/dices are rolled and the user will have to choose between rolling or to
    stop unless the total sum is 21 or bigger

    If the total sum is 21 and the player has gambled Bitcoins
        The game is done, the player wins and those Bitcoins are added to the
        original sum and removed from the bank

    Else if the total sum is over 21 and the player has gambled Bitcoins
        The game is done, the player loses and those Bitcoins are removed from the
        original sum and added to the bank

Else if the user stops
    The users total sum is compared to the computers and the one closest to 21 wins

    If user wins and has gambled Bitcoins
        Those Bitcoins are added to the original sum and removed from the bank

    Else if user loses and has gambled Bitcoins
        Those Bitcoins are removed from the original sum and added to the bank
